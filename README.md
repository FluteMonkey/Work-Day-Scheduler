# 05 Work Day Scheduler

## add events to your workday schedule at anytime

- allows you to add events to specific times in the day with just the press of a button. The planner also changes colour based on if that time in the day has passed or not!

## BUSINESS CONTEXT
 Poor time management can result in missed meetings and deadlines or create the appearance of unprofessionalism. A daily planner allows employees to see their day at a glance, schedule time effectively, and improve productivity.



This application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.

Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.

The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.

GIVEN that an employee adds events to a specific hour in a calendar

WHEN the employee clicks the save button

THEN events are saved in the timeblock for that hour
